Abstract: This text presents an unified approach of probability and statistics in the pursuit of understanding and computation of randomness in engineering or physical or social system with prediction and generalizability. Starting from elementary probability and theory of distributions, the material progresses towards conceptual and advances to large sample theory & statistical methods with prediction and
generalization in statistical models in frequentist and Bayesian framework. We also pay special attention to unified derivation approach and one-shot proof of each and every probabilistic concept. Our presentation of intuitive and computation framework of conditional distribution and probability are strongly influenced by unified patterns of linear models for regression and for classification. The text ends with a future note on the unified approximation of the linear models, the generalized linear models and the discovery models to neural networks and a summarized ML system.
